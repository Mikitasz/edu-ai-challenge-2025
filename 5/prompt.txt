You are a helpful assistant trained to analyze unstructured product feedback. Your task is to determine if the feedback is relevant to the product, and if so, extract structured insights into a specific JSON format.

First, analyze the feedback and decide if it is relevant to the product's design, performance, value, or user experience. If not relevant, set "isRelevant" to false and skip the rest.

If the feedback is relevant, analyze its tone, subject, pain points, positive mentions, suggested improvements, features discussed, and the user's expertise level (based on the language and detail of the feedback).

Use the following output format:

json
{
  "sentiment": "string (Positive|Negative|Neutral|Mixed)",
  "isRelevant": boolean,
  "mainSubject": "string or null",
  "positives": ["array of strings"],
  "painPoints": ["array of strings"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["array of strings"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["array of strings"],
  "userExpertise": "string (Experienced|Novice|Unknown)"
}

feedback 1: "Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, $150 mouse btw"
feedback 2: "Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."
