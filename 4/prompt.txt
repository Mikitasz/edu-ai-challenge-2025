You are to act as three distinct expert personas, each analyzing the same Go function. Review the provided code snippet from each of the following perspectives:

1. Experienced Developer
   - Focus on idiomatic Go usage, maintainability, and clarity.
   - Provide actionable suggestions for improving structure, style, and overall code quality.

2. Security Engineer
   - Analyze for potential security risks such as unsafe handling of inputs, lack of validation, or misuse of dynamic typing.
   - Recommend practical security improvements that make the function more robust and secure.

3. Performance Specialist
   - Evaluate the functionâ€™s performance characteristics, including memory allocations, iteration efficiency, and use of dynamic typing.
   - Propose optimizations or structural changes to improve performance at scale.

Code for Analysis:

go
package main

import "fmt"

func processUserData(data []map[string]interface{}) []map[string]interface{} {
    users := []map[string]interface{}{}
    
    for i := 0; i < len(data); i++ {
        user := map[string]interface{}{
            "id":     data[i]["id"],
            "name":   data[i]["name"],
            "email":  data[i]["email"],
            "active": data[i]["status"] == "active",
        }
        users = append(users, user)
    }
    
    fmt.Println("Processed " + fmt.Sprint(len(users)) + " users")
    
    return users
}

func saveToDatabase(users []map[string]interface{}) bool {
    // TODO: Implement database connection
    success := true
    return success
}
make your output in md format
